</ul>

<h2>South Korea's Political Crisis</h2>
<p>South Korea's opposition's call for President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment has sent shockwaves through the market. The won weakened and Korean stocks declined sharply as investors grapple with the uncertainty. This event underscores the potential for geopolitical risks to disrupt global markets.</p>

<h2>French Political Uncertainty</h2>
<p>France faces its own political turmoil as President Emmanuel Macron seeks to avoid a government collapse. While markets have remained relatively calm, concerns persist about potential economic consequences, including higher borrowing costs and a weaker euro.</p>

<h2>US Markets: A Haven Amidst Global Turmoil</h2>
<p>Despite global headwinds, US markets continue to outperform. Strong earnings from tech giants like Salesforce and Marvell, driven by AI advancements, have further bolstered investor sentiment. The prospect of a business-friendly Trump administration also contributes to the positive outlook for US equities.</p>

<h2>UK Market Shrinking</h2>
<p>The UK stock market is facing a decline due to a surge in M&A activity. Numerous companies are delisted from the London Stock Exchange, highlighting the attractiveness of UK assets to global acquirers. This trend is likely to continue as UK valuations remain significantly lower than global peers.</p>

<h2>Gold Outlook</h2>
<p>BofA Securities remains bullish on gold, forecasting a price target of $3,000/oz by the end of 2025. This outlook is driven by factors such as geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and potential central bank buying.</p>
